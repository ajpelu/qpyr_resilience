# Summary 
In this repo we explore the resilience of *Q. pyrenaica* forests of Sierra Nevada. For this purpose we evaluate the evolution of the Enhanced Vegetation Index ([EVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_vegetation_index)) (a surrogate of producitivity) of these forests from 2000 to 2014.  We used MODIS images to compute the EVI index. We analyze the effects of the worst drought episody ever recording in the southern of Iberian Peninsula ([see García-Herrera et al. 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM578.1)). Following the approach of [Lloret et al. (2011) ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19372.x) and [Herrero and Zamora (2014)] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087842), we compute the several resilience components to evaluate the effects of the drought event on the productivity of these forests and their ability to respond to a disturbance. 
Then we analyze the pattern of the resilience componentes in these forests under diferent hypthoesis: 
* There is a pattern of the resilience components with elevation.  We hypothesize that the Resilience is higher at greater elevations
* There is a heterogeneous pattern of the resilience components among the different populations. Our hypothesis here is that populations located in northern slopes will have greater values of resilience that southern ones. 
* Finally we want to explore the pattern of the resilience components under different treatment: forest irrigated with "artificial-irrigation channels (acequias)" and non-irrigated.
