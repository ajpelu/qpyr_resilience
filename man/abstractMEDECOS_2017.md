Abstract
--------

Climate change projections predict an increase in the frequency of extreme events (e.g. droughts). This increase could result in reduced resilience of ecosystems, particularly in populations located in the rear edge of its distribution.

In this work, we evaluate the drought impacts in the greenness of Quercus pyrenaica forests in Sierra Nevada, a Mediterranean high-mountain (southern Spain). Summers 2005 and 2012 were two of the worst drought episodes ever recorded in this Mediterranean area. Our main objectives were: *(i)* to evaluate how each drought event has affected the greenness of this forest ecosystem; *(ii)* to analyze the resistance and resilience of this ecosystem to consecutive extreme drought events; and *(iii)* to explore differences of the forest resilience between southern and northern populations.

We used Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data derived from MODIS-MOD13Q1 product to characterize vegetation greenness during the period 2000-2015. At a pixel-scale, we calculate EVI monthly anomalies for each drought event (2005 and 2012) relative to reference period. Resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience of the forest greenness to each drought event were also calculated.

Vegetation greenness of 2005 and 2012 were lower than the reference period, especially for late-spring and summer with a higher EVI anomalies. The 2005 drought event impacted more deeply to vegetation greenness than the 2012 drought. A substantial reduction of EVI greenness was observed during 2005 summer.

Reduction in EVI was higher for northern populations than southern ones. Significant differences were found on resilience components between northern and southern populations, with southern showing more resilient.
