# Resilience components 

![Figure 1.](/man/images/resilience_lloret.png) 

* ***Resistance*** (Rt) is considered as reversal of the reduction in ecological performance during disturbance, and it is estimated as the ratio between the performance during and before the disturbance. 

> Resistance: 
> ratio between the greenness during disturbance (drought period) and greenness during pre-disturbance period 

* ***Recovery*** (Rc) is the ability to recover relative to the damage experienced during disturbance, and it is estimated as the ratio between performance after and during disturbance 

> Recovery: 
> ratio betwenn the post-disturbance greenness and the greenness during the respective disturbance period (drought)

* ***Resilience*** (Rs) is the capacity to reach pre-disturbance performance levels, and it is estimated as the ratio between the performance after and before disturbance 

> Resilence: 
> ratio betwenn the post-disturbance greenness and the the pre-disturbance greenness 

* ***Relative resilience*** is the resilience weighted by the damage experienced during disturbance, and it is estimated as: 
RR = (post - dist) / pre 

* The rationale for this index is that the ability to achieve the levels of pre-disturbance performance depends on the impact  during the disturbance. 
* Values lower than 1 indicates that the effect of the event persists after disturbance, with lower values indicating decreasing resilience. High resistance to the disturbance (low levels of damage) reduce the relative resilience, while low resistance increases it. Relative resilience may have negative values if post-disturbance performance is lower than performance during the disturbance event.
