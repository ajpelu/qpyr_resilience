# Drought indices

## The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)

* It enables measurement of both wetness and dryness based on the supply and demand concept of the water balance equation 
* It incorporates prior precipitation, moisture supply, runoff and evaporation demand at the surface level. 
* scPDSI solves many of the problems of PDSI
 * it is spatially comparable 
* Shortcomings 
 * fixed temporal scale (9 - 12 months)
 * Autorregresive problems: index values are affected by the conditions up to four years in the past 
 
## The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI)

* It is a multiscalar index 
*
