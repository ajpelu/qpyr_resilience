# Tentative scheme

* Importance of the drought in Mediterranean Forests
* Drought and climate change 
* Two of the worst droughts events were 2005 and 2012 

* Impacts of the drought events on productivity of a species located in the rear edge of their distribution

## Questions?
* How droughts events have affected to functioning of the Pyrenean oak forests located in the rear edge of the distribution? 

* Como de resilientes son estos bosques localizados en el rear edge? 

* Are there differences between northern and southern populations regarding resilience? 

# Introduction 

# Material and methods 
## Remote Sensing information
## Drought characterizacion 
## Dendrochronological data 
## Resilience metrics 

For each dependent variable (i.e.: greenness and tree growth) we calculated several resilience metrics described by `TODO` `CITA LLORET`. 
Specifically ... (aqui un par de líneas introductorias sobre estos índices). 

`TODO` especificar cuantos años consideramos 

***Resistance*** (Rt) indicates the severity of the impact of the disturbance in the period it occurred. It was estimated as the ratio between the dependent variable during disturbance (drought period) and before disturbance period (pre drought period):

$$Rt = Drought/Predrought$$ 





is considered as reversal of the reduction in ecological performance during disturbance, and it is estimated as the ratio between the performance during and before the disturbance.
