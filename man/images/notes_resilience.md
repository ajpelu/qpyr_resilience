# Resilience components 

![Figure 1.](/man/images/resilience_lloret.png) 

* ***Resistance*** (Rt) is considered as reversal of the reduction in ecological performance during disturbance, and it is estimated as the ratio between the performance during and before the disturbance. 

> Resistance: 
> ratio between the greenness during disturbance (drought period) and greenness during pre-disturbance period 

* ***Recovery*** (Rc) is the ability to recover relative to the damage experienced during disturbance, and it is estimated as the ratio between performance after and during disturbance 

> Recovery: 
> ratio betwenn the post-disturbance greenness and the greenness during the respective disturbance period (drought)

* ***Resilience*** (Rs) is the capacity to reach pre-disturbance performance levels, and it is estimated as the ratio between the performance after and before disturbance 

> Resilence: 
> ratio betwenn the post-disturbance greenness and the the pre-disturbance greenness 

* ***Relative resilience*** is the resilience weighted by the damage experienced during disturbance, and it is estimated as: 
RR = (post - dist) / pre
