# Drought indices

## The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)

* It enables measurement of both wetness and dryness based on the supply and demand concept of the water balance equation 
* It incorporates prior precipitation, moisture supply, runoff and evaporation demand at the surface level. 
* scPDSI solves many of the problems of PDSI
 * it is spatially comparable 
* Shortcomings 
 * fixed temporal scale (9 - 12 months)
 * Autorregresive problems: index values are affected by the conditions up to four years in the past 
 
## The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI)

* It is a multiscalar index 
* 


* The SPI for long-term time scales (3 - 6 months) is considered an agricultural drought index (McKee et al., 1993, 1995; Hayes et al., 1999) because it indicates the water content of vegetation and the soil moisture conditions (Sims et al., 2002; Ji and Peters, 2003).

* The SPI at 12 months is considered a hydrological drought index, because it is used for monitoring surface water resources, e.g. river flows (Szalai et al., 2000; Hayes et al., 1999).

## Drought over Iberian Peninsula 
* 2004/2005 hydrological year was characterized by one of the worst droughts ever recorded in the Iberian Peninsula (Garc√≠a-Herrera et al. 2007). Less than 40 % of the climatological precipitation being registered in the southern sectors

* During the hydrological years of 2004/2005 and 2011/2012, Iberia was hit by two of the worst drought episodes ever recording in this semi-arid region (Garcia-Herrera at al., 2007; Trigo et al., 2013).


* Effects of droughts on plant phenology (NDVI) are visible, especially for the years 1999 and 2005 (both characterized by prolonged dry periods)
