Abstract
--------


Climate change projections predict an increase in the frequency of extreme events (e.g. droughts). This increase could result in reduced resilience of ecosystems, particularly in populations located in the rear edge of its distribution. 

2005 and 2012 were two of the worst drought episodies ever recording in south of Spain 


In this work we analyze the effect of the two worst drought episodes ever recording in the south of Spain (2005 and 2012) on the greeness of Q. pyrenaica forest located in Sierra Nevada. 


In this work, we evaluate the drought impacts on the greenness of the Quercus pyrenaica forests in Sierra Nevada, a high-mountain located in southern Spain. Specifically we Our aims were to analyze the impacts of the two severest drought events ever recorded on the productivity of this forests







In this work we evaluate the drought impacts on the greenness of the Quercus pyrenaica forests

The aim of this work es analizar la resiliencia de los bosques de q. pyrenaica frente a dos eventos de sequñia extremos. En concreto queremos evaluar como le han afectado los dos eventos de sequía y como han respondindo. Para ello 


Our aim was to analyze the impacts of two severe drought events on the grenness of Q. pyrenaica forests in Sierra Nevada which constituted the located in the rear edge of its distribution 


In this work we analyze the colonization pattern of abandoned croplands by Quercus pyrenaica in Sierra Nevada. We aimed to assess differences among populations in the rear edge of its distribution.


In this work we aimed to 


In this work we analyze the effect of the two worst drought episodes ever recording in the south of Spain (2005 and 2012) on the greeness of Q. pyrenaica forest located in Sierra Nevada. 

We aim to evaluate how each drought-event has affected the greeness of this ecosystem and also the resilience of these forest 


We use a temporal serie from 2000-2015 of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) product MOD13Q1 and 


Spectral vegation index constitute on the best tools for monitoring the primary production of ecosystem at the global scale. 


images of  Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were derived from MODIS sensor between 2000 and 2012 (MOD13Q1 product). The spatial resolution was 231 m and 16 days .. 




During the hydrological years of 2004/2005 and 2011/2012, Iberia was hit by two of the worst drought episodes ever recording in this semi-arid region




Notes
-----

-   Remote sensing can efficiently track stress responses of forests and other vegetation overa large regions at high frequency (see (Norman et al. 2016))

-   Ventajas del uso de RS (y + especificamente MODIS) para evaluar la sequía (ver (Norman et al. 2016) y referencias asociadas ((Mildrexler et al. 2007, 2009, 2016))

-   Ojo controlar si ha cambiado la estación de crecimiento. The phenological timing can vary (by a week) yearly, and such variation can obscure recognition and measurement of the seasonal effects of drought (Norman et al. 2016))
