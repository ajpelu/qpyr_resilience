title 1: Greenness's resilience of *Quercus pyrenaica* forests to two extreme drought events: A study case from Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). 

title 2: Resilience of the greenness of the Q. pyrenaica forests of Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) to two consecutive extreme drought events.


Climate change projections predict an increase in the frequency of extreme events (e.g. droughts). This increase could result in reduced resilience of ecosystems, particularly in populations located in the rear edge of its distribution. 

In this work, we evaluate the drought impacts on the greenness of the *Quercus pyrenaica* forests in Sierra Nevada, a high-mountain located in southern Spain. Summers 2005 and 2012 were two of the worst drought episodes ever recorded in this Mediterranean area. Our main objectives were: i) to evaluate how each drought event has affected the greenness of this forest type; ii) to analyze the resistance and resilience of this ecosystem to consecutive extreme drought events; and iii) to explore differences of the forest resilience between southern and northern populations. 

Using remote sensing information (MODIS MOD13Q1 product), we obtained a temporal series (2000-2015) of the greenness of the forests by computing the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We computed the anomaly of

Notes
-----

-   Remote sensing can efficiently track stress responses of forests and other vegetation overa large regions at high frequency (see (Norman et al. 2016))

-   Ventajas del uso de RS (y + especificamente MODIS) para evaluar la sequía (ver (Norman et al. 2016) y referencias asociadas ((Mildrexler et al. 2007, 2009, 2016))

-   Ojo controlar si ha cambiado la estación de crecimiento. The phenological timing can vary (by a week) yearly, and such variation can obscure recognition and measurement of the seasonal effects of drought (Norman et al. 2016))
