### Responses of natural vegetation to extreme drought 
Zhao et al (2015) performed a review of drought impacts on vegetation using NDVI (see [doi: 10.3390/rs71014039](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs71014039)) 

Walker et al. (2015) explore the vegetation response to drought events and showed the dependency of the response on microsite parameters (high/low elevations, etc) ([doi: 10.3390/rs70810832](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs70810832))

### `Growing season and NDVI`
Some researches have used several methods to estimate the growing season of vegetation based on NDVI data (see Wang et al. 2016 for a review). 

* `Q`: How long is the growing season of Q. pyrenaica? At national scale? at regional scale?. `TODO`: Thinking about that and talk with `FJB` and `D. Alcaraz`. See Wang et al. 2016 (doi: [10.1007/s11629-015-3465-2](doi.org/10.1007/s11629-015-3465-2))

### Correlation between NDVI (or EVI) with climatic data
See He et al. 2015 ([doi: 10.3390/rs70809998](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs70809998)). For our study we need consider the source data. We have two sets of data: 
* `OBSNEV`: Data up to 2010. Yearly data. 
* `CDomingo`: monthly data (up to 2015). No stations located at high elevations. 

### Use of NDVI-MODIS 
* Hlasny et al. 2015: Oak and Beech forests ([doi:10.1007/s13595-014-0404-2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-014-0404-2))
* Ogaya et al. 2015: Satellite data and holm oak forests ([doi: 10.1007/s13595-014-0408-y](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-014-0408-y)). Very interesting approach exploring ndvi(evi) evolution of average values and drought-period values.
